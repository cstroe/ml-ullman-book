# Elements of ML Programming

These are my implementations of excercises from the ML97 edition of ["Elements of ML Programming" by Jeffrey D. Ullman](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-ML-Programming-ML97-2nd/dp/0137903871).

I'm using the [Standard ML of New Jersey](http://www.smlnj.org/) implementation of ML:

```
Standard ML of New Jersey v110.79 [built: Wed Feb 17 01:03:23 2016]
```

To run any script just pipe it into the `sml` executable:

```
sml < file.sml
```

At some point in the future it would be good to use [CM](http://www.smlnj.org/doc/CM/index.html) and [a testing framework](https://github.com/kvalle/sml-testing) for managing this as a project.
