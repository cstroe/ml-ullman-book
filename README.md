# Elements of ML Programming

These are my implementations of excercises from the ML97 edition of "Elements of ML Programming" by Jeffrey D. Ullman.

I'm using the Standard ML of New Jersey implementation of ML:

```
Standard ML of New Jersey v110.79 [built: Wed Feb 17 01:03:23 2016]
```

To run any script just pipe it into the `sml` executable:

```
sml < file.ml
```
